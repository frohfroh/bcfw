This is a Traffic assignment library
In particular the bi conjugated Frank Wolf method, as described in 
Maria Mitradjieva, Per Olov Lindberg, (2013) The Stiff Is Movingâ€”Conjugate Direction Frank-Wolfe Methods with Applications
to Traffic Assignment*. Transportation Science 47(2):280-293. http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.1120.0409

Another project(yet to be made public) using this library shall provide a user-friendly way of doing traffic assignments and also serve as an example of how to use this library
